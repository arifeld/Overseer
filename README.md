# Overseer
A multi-function moderation bot, primarily designed for the discord.gg/teamagers community.

This repository has been made temporarily public for the purpose of applying for university credit.

This bot has been developed by me over the course of a few years and is built entirely in Javascript. 
This repository has not been actively updated however as the project is only maintained by myself and setting up a pipeline to deploy from GitHub was not justified in this case.
